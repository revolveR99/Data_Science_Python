1. Clone this repo
2. Put c0x_main.c (only one that you need) AND run.sh into root of your 
clonned repo with folders 
e.g ex00 ex01 etc..
3. type in terminal "chmod +x run.sh"
4. After moving run.sh and c0x_main.c to the root folder, delete 42_mains 
folder otherwise it wont work
5. Run from the terminal "./run.sh"
6. If someone didnt return all files (e.g didnt return folder ex08), you 
have to remove 1 line from the top of the c0x_main.c (function prototype 
that should be in that folder that person didnt return)
7. You should see norminette checks + every exercise if is it correct 
8. if you find something wrong pls write me on slack @osuchane thank 
you
